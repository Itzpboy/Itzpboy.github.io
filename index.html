                                     A reserved person by nature,<br>

                                    A girl with great <span id="girl">ambitions</span>,<br>
                                    A rare type of person,<br>
                                    Someone who belives in walking alone,<br>
                                    She moves on forward without fear,<br>
                                    She claims to be <em>Unbreakable</em>,<br>
                                    Most people thinks she's a loner,<br>
                                    But she just love being alone,<br>
                                    She may be fierce at times,<br>
                                    But most of it is a <strong>Facade</strong>,<br>
                                    She's just afraid of hurting those close to her,<br>
                                    She needs to face her fears,<br>
                                    But keeps avoiding it,<br>
                                    There is someone willing to stand by her,<br>
                                    To face it with her,<br>
                                    Still she hesitates afraid of the outcome,<br>
                                    But whatever decision she makes,<br>
                                    The personn will respect it,<br>
                            <strong>She will surely be as expected a CHAMPION.</strong>
